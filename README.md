# 01 Challenge: Refactoring a Marketing Homepage

_In this hypothetical, a marketing company has asked that their home page be updated to meet accessibility standards_

To further improve the site, in addition to alt tags, the following changes have been made:

    1.) All non-semantic elements have been updated with more descriptive semantic tags.

    2.) Redundant properties (ones that share the same values) have been consolidated under the same selector

    3.) Comments have been added to mark any changes made to the code. Comments have also been made to better organize and denote the various sections of the webpage.
